Health and safety is one of the few areas where the law places specific duties specifically on employees so a knowledge of where this applies and how to ensure that it is adhered to is vital to protect individuals and businesses.

									The course covers a wide range of topics including fire safety, asbestos awareness, working at height, COSHH, PPE and electricity. It also covers schemes for improving safety performance and methods of protecting the environment.</p>
